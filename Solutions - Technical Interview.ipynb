    "\n",
    "In 2011 AirBnB ran some experiments which showed that when a property featured professional photography, users were much more likely to trust the property and consequently make a booking. So, AirBnB a launched free professional photography service for all hosts. From inside the listing page, hosts were able to click a link to view more about the service, request a professional photographer, and subsequently (after the photo shoot) have their property profile updated with professional photos.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project initially proved to be a success:\n",
    "\n",
    "Guests were more likely to book a property that had professional photography.\n",
    "Hosts were able to charge more for listings with professional photos.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, over time this also became a multimillion dollar operation and a challenge to manage across over 200 countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fast forward to 2016, and some new developments have also helped with building trust:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2013: Launch of identity verification for hosts and guests.\n",
    "- 2014: Launch of double blind reviews (neither host nor guest can see the otherâ€™s review), ensuring more honest reviews of properties and hosts.\n",
    "- 2015: Huge global PR lift for AirBnB, raising the profile of the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional interesting development has also been the proliferation of smartphones with powerful and high-quality cameras (+apps) over the last few years, which has made it more possible for hosts to take good quality photos of their property. There is also the opinion that perhaps millennials have come to expect smartphone photos as the norm and are less likely to expect professional photography."

    "- Some of the hosts not using the service could be proffessional photographers themselves\n",
    "- Some of the hosts not using the service could be targetting people travelling on a budget and therefore do not see the need to take better pictures of a crammed single room\n",
    "- Some of the hosts not using the service might not be active hosts, just rent out occasionally or have the listing up just for fun and by default.\n",
    "\n",

If the control group could be filtered, it would also be of benefit to add a control group in the first scenario, when drawing a chronical comparison, to detect and filter general trends that do not occurr do to the change in image quality. A good choice of control group would be the hosts that are on the waiting list for the photo service. "

    "A ride hailing app currently assigns new incoming trips to the closest available vehicle. To compute such distance, the app currently computes haversine distance between the pickup point and each of the available vehicles. We refer to this distance as linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the expected time to reach A from B in a city is not 100% defined by Haversine distance: cities are known to be places where huge amount of transport infrastructure (roads, highways, bridges, tunnels) is deployed to increase capacity and reduce average travel time. Interestingly, this heavy investment in infrastructure also implies that bird distance does not work so well as proxy, so the isochrones for travel time from certain location drastically differ from the perfect circle defined by bird distance, as we can see in this example from CDMX where the blue area represents that it is reachable within a 10 min drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this, travel times can be drastically affected by traffic, accidents, road work...So that even if a driver is only 300m away, he might need to drive for 10 min because of road work in a bridge.\n",
